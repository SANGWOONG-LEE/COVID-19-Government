# Missing years 2019 and 2020 in U.S.

We use the US GSS 2021 and 2018 - available here: https://gss.norc.org -> Get the data -> STATA -> 2021 and 2018. That raw data is saved in inputs/data.

This paper has been examined to find out U.S citizens' opinions on government budget sectors that were changed by COVID-19. I have found that there existed variables that presented negative, positive and unchanged responses. This is important in a sense that it relates to lives as well as becomes an indication for why such gap exited. We will discuss its importance in details later in discussion session.
